â€‹ There are many ways to log in to the nike app, we basically talk about the following two;

1. Log in by Nike app protocol;

2. Log in the memory of the nike app;

The first way:-look at the first effect

The above is the effect of successful login. The goal is to get the Bearer string for use in the subsequent process; this edition does not discuss the subsequent process in detail.

Refer to this post for the follow-up process:



So what do we need?

1. We can grab a data packet of the login process;

We can find out through data packet analysis;

a. At present, _abck, bmsz, this is an old question that is often talked about, and I will not expand it in detail here. Commonly known as the akamai problem, it will be more common when working on the web side; if you can't get through here, it will be shown as a 403 return status code;

b. Also need to pay attention: x-kpsdk-ct and x-kpsdk-cd will produce a return status code of 429 if they are handled improperly;

2. When all the above four points are available, through appropriate simulation data packets, you can basically log in by protocol;



Supplement: (I understand, please walk away if you come over and pretend to be forced)

There are still a few points to pay attention to in the process of doing it yourself;

1. How to prepare abck and bmsz; this is indeed a problem if it is scaled up. Note here, of course if you are just testing,

This will become relatively easy if you know it;

2. The principle of x-kpsdk-cd is actually not complicated, that is, you can get it from the request, and then he will have a post submission method to verify;

But it is not recommended to deal with it again, why? Because basically your algorithm can't keep up with his update;

3. Can the value of x-kpsdk-ct be simulated by an algorithm, or it is relatively easy.
